## Instructions for reporting Android App Errors

In order to track down the bug you experienced in our error logs, we need to know a few key bits of info:

1. The exact Date + Time the error last occurred.
Example: 7/22 4:52pm

2. Android Version Number
Example: Android 9

3. Model Number 
Example: XT1900-1

4. Loveland App Version Number
Example: 1.14

5. Loveland App Total Space Used
Example: 159 MB


**Note that:**

- The Model Number will never change, so you'll only need to get it once if you can associate it with a single Surveyor or device.
- The Android Version will change occasionally.
- The Date+Time and Loveland Version Number is needed for every bug.
- Total Space Used is useful for us to know if your phone is running out of space.
- Below is the process for getting the Android Version Number, the Model Number, the Loveland App   Version Number, and the Total Space Used.
