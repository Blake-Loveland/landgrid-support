# Developing

## Prereqs

You'll need jekyll:

```gem install jekyll```

## Run the site for development

This will run jekyll. It'll watch for changes, automatically build the site,
and serve it locally at http://localhost:4000.

```jekyll serve```

## Where are the files?

Templates are in the root directory. The generated site is in `/_site`.
