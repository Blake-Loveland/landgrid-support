**About Query**

Site Control gives you powerful tools to explore and understand the data you bring to your account. One of these tools is Query -- a search interface that allows you to select multiple criteria from data in LOVELAND's database as well as datasets and survey data you bring to your account.

Below are a series of examples of searches run using Query.

**Single-criteria search:**
