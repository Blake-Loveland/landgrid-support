On the toolbar in the upper left of the map, you'll see an icon of a printer. Click this button, and two options appear:

**Print PDF Map: clicking this will prompt a popup where you can generate a PDF image of your Project - not only the map, but the legend, and (if selected) summary details of the project.
Save Image: a .PNG image will download of just the map extent as shown on your screen. 

PS If you are looking for a way to share your Project with others digitally, you can [check out this article](https://support.landgrid.com/articles/share-a-map) to learn how.
