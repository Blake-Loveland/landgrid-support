_Note: the "Save Image" function is the first step in a larger attempt to provide users ways to print and export their maps. Stay tuned for a refined tool and other updates!_

On the toolbar in the upper left of the map, you'll see an icon of a camera with "Save Image" underneath. Click this button, and a .PNG image will download. 

**Note: Currenly, only the map (parcels, color coding etc) itself is captured in the image.**

PS If you are looking for a way to share your Project with others digitally, you can [check out this article](https://support.landgrid.com/articles/share-a-map) to learn how.
