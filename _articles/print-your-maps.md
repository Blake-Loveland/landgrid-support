On the toolbar in the upper left of the map, you'll see an icon of a printer. Click this button, and two options appear:

**Print PDF Map:** clicking this will prompt a popup where you can generate a PDF image of your Project - not only the map, but the legend, and (if selected) summary details of the project.

**Save Image:** a .PNG image will download of just the map extent as shown on your screen. 

**Print a Specific Parcel's Info:** You can print a specific properties' information by clicking the parcel, then 'Actions' at the top right, then 'Print Parcel'. The resulting PDF will look something like the following:
![Print_Parcel_Details.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/Print_Parcel_Details.jpg)
