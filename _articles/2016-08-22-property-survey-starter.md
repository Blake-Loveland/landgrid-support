intro: How to begin your property survey with Site Control Starter
title: Start Your Property Survey with Site Control Starter
---
**Introduction**  
Site Control Starter users can use our basic, built-in survey and go into their cities and neighborhoods equipped with the LOVELAND App to take pictures and answer questions about property. The data and photography collected is attached to the parcels surveyed and saved privately in your Site Control account where you can use it to build maps and make decisions supported by the latest information collected on the ground. If you would like to create a custom survey, [upgrade to Site Control Pro](https://sitecontrol.us/plans). 

Here's how to get started with your property survey:

**Step 1:**   
Navigate to the survey page in your Site Control account and add our basic, built-in survey questions to your map:
