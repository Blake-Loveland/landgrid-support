If you have data in a Land Grid Project you no longer need or want to work with, you can remove it by going to the "Datasets" tab of your Land Grid account's home page. Then navigate to the dataset you want to delete, click "Edit" and at the bottom select "Delete". 

See below for an animation showing how to remove a dataset from your map:
