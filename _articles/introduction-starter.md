**Welcome to Site Control!**

**Overview**

Once you sign up for a [LOVELAND account](https://makeloveland.com/), you will have access to Site Control Starter. Site Control is your personal platform for working with property information. With Site Control, you can import property data, conduct a survey in the field with your mobile device, and map your survey results as they come streaming into your account in real-time. Site Control maps are easy to style so you can create beautiful interactive web maps without writing a single line of code. User-friendly tools like our data list view and our query builder help make complicated information digestible, so you can make well-informed planning and land use decisions while spending less time wrestling with parcel data.

**Are you ready to get started?**

* To get started with Site Control, the first you'll want to do is [create a map](https://sitecontrol.us/support/Create-a-New-Map).
