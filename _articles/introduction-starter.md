Introduction to the Land Grid – Free Account

**###Welcome to the Land Grid!**

**Overview**

If you’re reading this, you should have gained access to a free Land Grid account (if you haven’t yet, go to the main page, enter your info and click “Create Account”). With a free Land Grid account, your options are more limited than with a paid account – still, you can import property data, conduct a survey in the field with your mobile device, and map your survey results as they come streaming into your account in real-time. 

Some of the guides on this support page do not apply to users with a free account. If you would like to have access to ALL of Site Control’s great features, upgrade your account now for just $10/month.

Once you have data imported, Land Grid maps are easy to style so you can create beautiful interactive web maps without writing a single line of code. User-friendly tools like our data list view and our Filter function help make complicated information digestible, so you can make well-informed planning and land use decisions while spending less time wrestling with parcel data.

**Are you ready to get started?**
•	The first thing you’ll want to do is create a project.
•	Then, you might want to import data or start a property survey.
•	Once you add data to your map, you can filter your data and style your map.
