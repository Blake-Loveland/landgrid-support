Site Control Starter is your personal platform for working with property information. With Site Control, you can import property data, conduct a survey in the field with your mobile device, and map your survey results as they come streaming into your account in real-time. Site Control maps are easy to style so you can create beautiful interactive web maps without writing a single line of code. User-friendly tools like our data list view and our query builder help make complicated information digestible, so you can make well-informed planning and land use decisions while spending less time wrestling with parcel data.

**Are you ready to get started?**

* To get started with Site Control, the first you'll want to do is [create a map](https://loveland.github.io/support/articles/new-map/).
* Then, you might want to [import data](https://loveland.github.io/support/articles/add-data-via-csv/) or [start a property survey](https://loveland.github.io/support/articles/start-your-property-survey/).
* Once you add data to your map, you can [query your data](https://loveland.github.io/support/articles/how-to-query-data/) and [style your map](https://loveland.github.io/support/articles/style-data-on-your-map/).
