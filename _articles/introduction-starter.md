**Overview**

If you’re reading this, you should have gained access to a Landgrid Free account (if you haven’t yet, go [here](https://landgrid.com/users/sign_in)). You may be interested in viewing our [tutorial videos](https://landgrid.com/pages/tutorial-videos) which can help you get started. With a Langrid Free account, your options are more limited than with a paid account – you can surf 143 million parcels uninterrupted, draw focus areas and bookmark up to 10 parcels.

Many of the articles in this guidebook do not apply to users with a free account. If you would like to have access to ALL of Landgrid platform's great features, upgrade your account now for just $10/month, [here](https://landgrid.com/plans)).

**Here’s what you can do with your free account:**
 
* **Uninterrupted nationwide parcel viewer** - Look up parcels all over and get deeper insights into your neighborhood.
* **Map Layers** - Switch and toggle between satellite and street view.
* **Access Bounds** - Filter and add boundaries to your parcels based on zipcodes, Census tracts and congressional districts.
* **Top Owners** - Get a quick insight into the top property owners in your location.
