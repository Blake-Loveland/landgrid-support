Site Control Pro is your personal platform for working with property information. With Site Control, you can import property data, build custom property surveys, conduct your surveys in the field with your mobile device, and map your survey results as they come streaming into your account in real-time. Site Control maps are easy to style, share, and embed, so you can create beautiful interactive web maps without writing a single line of code. User-friendly tools like our data list view and our query builder help make complicated information digestible, so you can make well-informed planning and land use decisions while spending less time wrestling with parcel data.

**Are you ready to get started?**

* To get started with Site Control, the first you'll want to do is [create a map](https://loveland.github.io/support/articles/new-map/).
* Then, you might want to [import data](Importing Data via CSV) or [create a property survey](https://loveland.github.io/support/articles/start-your-property-survey/).
* Once you add data to your map, you can [query your data](https://loveland.github.io/support/articles/how-to-query-data/) and [style your map](https://loveland.github.io/support/articles/style-data-on-your-map/).

If you are working with others, be sure to [invite your team to collaborate](Invite Collaborators) in Site Control.
