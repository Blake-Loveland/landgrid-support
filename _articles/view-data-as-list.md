**About List View**  
The data you add to a landgrid.com Project, either through surveying properties or importing datasets, is all organized in a spreadsheet which can be viewed by clicking the "List" option on the sidebar.

As with other elements of landgrid.com, List contains data based on the boundary you are looking at when you click the icon. For example, if you are looking at the entire city of Chicago and click "List" you will have all the data in your Chicago landgrid.com Project appear in List, organized into pages of 100 properties per page. If, on the other hand, you click a neighborhood boundary, then click List, you will see data ONLY for the properties within that neighborhood boundary.

**Exporting Data from the List**  

You can export data from the List by clicking the "Download CSV" button. This, too, will extract data based on the boundaries you are currently viewing. So, if you click Download CSV while looking at a whole city, you'll download data for the entire city. If you click Download CSV from within in a neighborhood, you'll get data just for that neighborhood. Currently, landgrid.com accounts are allowed to download 50,000 records (ie 50,000 rows in List view) per day.

Please note, Free users will not be able to download this list. This option is available for Pro users and up.
