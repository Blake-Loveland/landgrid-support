## FAQ's - Landgrid's Knowledge Base

Find quick answers to any questions and doubts you may have about our products, services and company. We are always updating our FAQ's to make it as comprehensive as possible.

**Loveland Technologies - The Company**

**Q:** Are Loveland/makeloveland, landgrid.com & sitecontrol the same?

**A:** Loveland Technologies is the parent company, and landgrid.com is our website and platform.
Makeloveland was the old site and Sitecontrol was the older mapping platform. Now, post re-branding, all our products and solutions fall under landgrid.com.


**Q:** What are your current offerings?

**A:** We offer a suite of tools and products under 2 main categories. 
1. SaaS (Individual & Organization Tiers) - Landgrid mapping & surveying platform
2. DaaS - Bulk parcel data licenses if you’d like to purchase our data for use in your app or mapping software.
You can learn more about them [here](https://landgrid.com/plans)


**Q:** What happened to Site Control?

**A:** Site Control still exists but we are in the process of phasing it out. Makeloveland.com doesn't exist anymore and visitors are automatically rouated to landgrid.com. We really wanted to unite the two sites into one, and add additional functionality - it made more sense to build a new and improved site with better usability for our customers. This is the origin of landgrid.com!


**Q:** Who owns data that I import to your site?

**A:** You do! We don’t take or use any data that you have imported without your permission.


**Q:** Why do you have so many more fields for properties in one county than another?

**A:** This is usually due to the amount of information that the counties are making digitally available; we can’t provide data that we don’t have ourselves!
