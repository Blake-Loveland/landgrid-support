## FAQ's - Landgrid's Knowledge Base

Find quick answers to any questions and doubts you may have about our products, services and company. We are always updating our FAQ's to make it as comprehensive as possible.




**Loveland Technologies - The Company**

**Q:** Are Loveland/makeloveland, landgrid.com & sitecontrol the same?

**A:** Loveland Technologies is the parent company, and landgrid.com is our website and platform.
Makeloveland was the old site and Sitecontrol was the older mapping platform. Now, post re-branding, all our products and solutions fall under landgrid.com.


**Q:** What are your current offerings?

**A:** We offer a suite of tools and products under 2 main categories. 
1. SaaS (Individual & Organization Tiers) - Landgrid mapping & surveying platform
2. DaaS - Bulk parcel data licenses if you’d like to purchase our data for use in your app or mapping software.
You can learn more about them [here](https://landgrid.com/plans)


**Q:** What happened to Site Control?

**A:** Site Control still exists but we are in the process of phasing it out. Makeloveland.com doesn't exist anymore and visitors are automatically rouated to landgrid.com. We really wanted to unite the two sites into one, and add additional functionality - it made more sense to build a new and improved site with better usability for our customers. This is the origin of landgrid.com!


**Q:** Who owns data that I import to your site?

**A:** You do! We don’t take or use any data that you have imported without your permission.


**Q:** Why do you have so many more fields for properties in one county than another?

**A:** This is usually due to the amount of information that the counties are making digitally available; we can’t provide data that we don’t have ourselves!




**Parcel Data - FAQ's**

**Q:** How frequently do you update your data?

**A:** We try to refresh the data as and when possible. However, this varies by county. Check out our parcelverse & CSV to see specifics on the data attributes and the parcel age [here](https://landgrid.com/parcelverse#b=counties&s=/us)


**Q:** How do I know when you have added new data & parcels to your dataset?

**A:** We send monthly emails to our bulk data customers on data improvements and refreshes. And we update our Parcelverse CSV everytime there is a change to our parcel data. [Parcelverse](https://landgrid.com/parcelverse#b=counties&s=/us)


**Q:** What are the different attributes available in your data?

**A:** We aggregate property data, primarily from publicly available sources, in addition to a handful of fields that we derive from subscription databases. Our data richness varies by county (Check out the Landgrid [Parcelverse](https://landgrid.com/parcelverse#b=counties&s=/us)) but includes such data as  parcel boundaries, descriptive information about the parcel, owner, owner address, last sales price and date where available, as well as any other information that we deem to be available, valuable and worth collecting.


**Q:** What if I’m interested in a county that you don’t have any information on currently?

**A:** You can always email us at team@makeloveland.com or ‘request this county’ from within the platform; while we are always very interested to hear user requests, please be patient with us - we are a small team and cover the entire United States, so it can take a while for your request to be factored into the queue. In addition, some counties and states have privacy laws that prevent us from obtaining data there, no matter how much we would like it. 

If lack of coverage for a specific county is a dealbreaker for you, please reach out - we may be able to put together a package just for you that factors in the additional cost of procuring that area and changing the parcel pipeline.


**Q:** Where does your data come from?

**A:** Most of the base data that you see on our site is aggregated from County Assessor/Auditor data, and is available for public consumption.




**Landgrid Data - Bulk Parcel Data Licensing FAQ's**

**Q:** Our data licensing needs vary from time to time. Can we approach Loveland for our varying needs?

**A:** Yes. We work to be a flexible provider and try to provide customers with what they need at any scale.


**Q:** Do you include vacancy data in your dataset?

**A:** We’re in the process of adding RDI (residential/nonresidential binary indicator) and vacancy fields to our data. It should be available by end of Summer, 2019.


**Q:** Do you make custom data refreshes?

**A:** Depending on what type of data and the cost in time and energy to our staff, we certainly do! Contact us with specifics, and we can let you know in more detail.



**Q:** What happens to the data after our parcel license has expired? 

**A:** The data is licensed for your use for one year only. After the year, you must either renew your license or delete our data anywhere it may have been stored.



**Q:** Do you customize the data set to meet our needs?

**A:** In almost all cases, we provide our data on an as-is basis.



**Q:** I’m interested in looking at a sample of your data. Is this possible?

**A:** We pride ourselves on making sure that customers are buying data that they want, and which works for them - so yes, in most cases! Contact our data licensing team at parcels@landgrid.com for more information.
