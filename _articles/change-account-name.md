You can change the name of your Land Grid account any time you want. Select the dropdown menu with your account's name from the top menu. Then, select Preferences and update your group's name. You can also update your account's custom url (for example, to make it shorter and easier to type). You can watch a video on editing your group's information [here.](https://youtu.be/IxQAi0AD6WA)
