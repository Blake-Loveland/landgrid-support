## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About Landgrid Parcel Data

## API Access

**What is an API and why might I use one?**

API stands for Application Programming Interface, and is for use by software developers to interact directly with our national dataset. They are usually used when someone wants to automate some process that interacts with our national parcel dataset. All APIs require programming work to make them useful for any specific application.

**What APIs does Landgrid make available?**

We provide two different APIs for working with our data. Please remember, all APIs are intended for use by software developers and are not for end users’ direct use.

Tile Map Service (TMS) Layer - This is an interactive, vecotr rendering of our dataset, for use in web or desktop applications where using the parcel shapes overlaid on other layers is useful. Landgrid’s TMS layer is in Mapbox Vector Tile (.mvt) format. [https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/reference/](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/reference/)

RESTful API - This is a typical stateless, client/server based API that supports retrieving parcel shape and meta data using lat / lon coordinates, among other options. Please see [https://support.landgrid.com/articles/using-the-api/](https://support.landgrid.com/articles/using-the-api/) for a complete reference to the API.
