If things start to get crowded and you want to delete a project, you have two options.

In your list of maps under "Group Maps," use the "Shortcuts" drop down list to "Delete Map."

Or open the project, open the Project panel from the left-hand menu, and select "Delete Project" from the "Save Project" dropdown menu.
