If things start to get crowded and you want to delete a Project, you have two options.

**Option 1**

On the left hand sidebar, click the gear icon, found underneath Overview. There is a white triangle in the "Save Project" button at the top of the drawer which pops out; click this, and select "Delete Project".

**Option 2**

From the "My Profile" page (click top right corner dropdown with username, then "My Profile") find the Project that you would like to delete. Click on the "Shortcuts" button on the same row as your projects' name, and select "Delete Project".
