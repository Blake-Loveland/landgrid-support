intro: How to delete a map you no longer want
---
Accounts for Individuals can create up to 10 maps, Group Accounts may create up to 30 (get in touch at team@makeloveland.com if you need more). If things start to get crowded and you want to delete a map, you have two options.

In your list of maps under "Group Maps," use the "Shortcuts" drop down list to "Delete Map."

Or open the map, click "Preferences" and "Delete Map." See below for a quick walkthrough:
