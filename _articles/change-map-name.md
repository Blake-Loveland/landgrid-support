You can change the name of your project at any time.

Browse to your project and select the Project panel from the right-hand column. Then, update the name and press "Save" at the bottom of the panel. 

You can also write a description in the box below the title. The description will appear below the name. Descriptions can be useful when you want to do something like embed your map in a web page -- your description will be a part of the embed, giving people an introduction to your map.
