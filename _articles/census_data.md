Census Data is available on landgrid.com by clicking the "Census" tab on the blue left hand sidebar.

**Note** Census Data only shows at Census geographies: nation, state, county, city, census tract, and block group. Change your geography type under the "Bounds" dropdown menu, located at the top of your screen.
