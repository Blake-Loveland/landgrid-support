### Where does Loveland source parcel data from?

We source our data directly from each County or another equivalent official source.

### What counties does Loveland have?

[A current, detailed list of every County in the US and what data fields we have for each is available online](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q0PZB72nO8935EMGmsh3864VjEAMUE-pdHcPkoAiS5c/). This spreadsheet can be downloaded as a CSV for closer analysis.

### When was the Loveland data last updated?

You can see the last refresh date of any county [in our coverage spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q0PZB72nO8935EMGmsh3864VjEAMUE-pdHcPkoAiS5c/edit).

We make every effort to update our data at least yearly, with major metro areas being updated twice a year. Going forward, we will be increasing the frequency of data updates to better match the individual County update schedules.

We work with our bulk data clients

Our initial nationwide dataset was collected in the 2015-2016 time frame and we still have some data from that time period.
