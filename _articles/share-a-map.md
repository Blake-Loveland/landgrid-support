Because we want to give you control over what you share, and who you share it with, there are a few ways to share a Land Grid project.

**Here is how to navigate to your project's sharing options:**

**Set the map's URL to "Anyone with the map's link can view it"**  
This is akin to sharing a document with "read-only" access. Anyone who receives your Site Control map's link will be able to view all the data, comments, notes, and survey information collected in the map, they will be able to export data in CSV format.

However, they will NOT be able to edit, delete, or modify any data in your map. They will not be able to access any of the menus under "Manage Map" which allow for manipulation of data and map settings. All of that will remain off limits.

Your map will be "live" -- that is as you add data to it, whoever has the link to your public map will see new data coming in.

You can always flip your sharing settings back to "Keep this map private" to remove the ability for people to see your map via its URL.

Note: Sharing in this fashion does NOT require the person you are sharing with to have a Land Grid account.

**Share with Other Accounts**  
This is akin to sharing a document with "read-only" access. Anyone who receives your Land Grid Project's link will be able to view all the data, comments, notes and survey information collected in the map. This access will also allow exporting of the data in CSV format.

**Embed Your Map**  
If you have a website, blog, news story, or other web page you’d like to embed a Land Grid map into, well cool! Simply copy the embed code for the project (HOW/WHERE) and insert using the HTML editor (or whatever the appropriate format is given the platform you’re publishing with).

Your embedded map will show things from the project like parcel color coding, commenting, your survey feed and data. Nothing will be editable by people interacting with the embedded map.

Your embedded map will be “live” – that is as you add data to it, people visiting your embedded map with will see new data coming in.
