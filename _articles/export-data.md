**About Data Exporting**  
Site Control allows you to export data from your account in a number of standard formats. We're always adding new ways to publish and extract data from your account, so keep an eye out for new options.

**How to Export Data**  
Click "Manage Map" and then "Share & Export" in order to see data export options. Then simply click the format in which you'd like to download your map's data. Currently supported formats are: CSV, XLS, SHP, and KML. Your download will include all the data you've collected and the associated parcel data. For bulk exports like county shapefiles, see our [Nationwide Parcel Data page](https://makeloveland.com/parcels).
