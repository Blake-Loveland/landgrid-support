**About Data Exporting**
Landgrid.com allows you to export data from your account in a number of standard formats (see below for options). We’re always adding new ways to publish and extract data from your account, so keep an eye out for new options.

**How to Export Data**
Click “Export” in your project’s left hand sidebar and choose the format which you’d like to download your data in. Currently, the supported formats are: CSV, XLS, SHP, and KML. Your download will include all the data you’ve collected and the associated parcel data. 

Interested in bulk exports of our parcel data? We offer downloads in a variety of formats and geographies.
