**Introduction**  
Site Control users can create custom surveys and go into their cities and neighborhoods equipped with the LOVELAND App to take pictures and answer questions about property. The data and photography collected is attached to the parcels surveyed and saved privately in your Site Control account where you can use it to build maps and make decisions supported by the latest information collected on the ground.

If you've already signed up for Site Control, here's how to get started with your very own property survey:

**Step 1:**   
Navigate to the survey creation page in your Site Control account and start building your survey questions:
