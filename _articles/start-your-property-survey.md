Title: Start Your Property Survey with Site Control Pro

**Introduction**  
Pro and Enterprise Site Control users can create custom surveys and go into their cities and neighborhoods equipped with the LOVELAND App to take pictures and answer questions about property. The data and photography collected is attached to the parcels surveyed and saved privately in your Site Control account where you can use it to build maps and make decisions supported by the latest information collected on the ground.

Here's how to get started with your very own property survey:

**Step 1:**   
Navigate to the survey creation page in your Site Control account and start building your survey questions:

**Step 5:**

**Step 6:**    
To survey a property, tap the outline of the parcel you want to survey. The parcel you've selected will shade in blue, and its address and Google Street View image will appear at the bottom of the device's screen. When you're ready to survey, tap the camera icon.

When you've reached the end of your survey questions, you'll see two buttons: "Submit Blext" or "Add Another Photo". If you'd like to add additional photos, tap Add Another Photo to keep taking pictures. When you're ready to send your survey and its data and photography to Site Control, tap "Submit Blext".

Back in your Site Control account, you can navigate in the map to the region you were surveying and click any highlighted parcel (denoting properties you've surveyed) to see the imagery and data. Or, you can click the "Feed" icon to see a stream of all the information you've collected in the map.
