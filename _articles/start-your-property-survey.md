**Introduction**  
Land Grid users with paid accounts can create custom surveys and go into their cities and neighborhoods equipped with the LOVELAND App to take pictures and answer questions about property. The data and photography collected is attached to the parcels surveyed and saved privately in your Land Grid account where you can use it to build maps and make decisions supported by the latest information collected on the ground.

Here's how to get started with your very own property survey:

**Step 1:**   
In your Land Grid account, navigate to the project you'd like to save your survey in and under the "Project" tab, start building your survey with the "Survey Editor" button.

Or, you can clik the "Feed" icon to see a stream of all the information you've collected in the project.
