**Introduction**  
landgrid.com users with paid accounts can create custom surveys and go into their cities and neighborhoods equipped with the LOVELAND App to take pictures and answer questions about property. The data and photography collected is attached to the parcels surveyed and saved privately in your landgrid.com account, where you can use it to build maps and make decisions supported by the latest information collected on the ground.

Here's how to get started with your very own property survey:

**Step 1:**   
In your landgrid.com account, navigate to the project you'd like to save your survey in. Click on "Survey" and then "Editor" in the sidebar to start building your survey, or add questions from premade surveys.

**Step 2:**   
When you're finished setting up your survey, **be sure to click "Save Survey"**


**Step 3:**   
If you haven't already, now's the time to download the LOVELAND Next App on your surveying device. A smart phone tablet, etc will work. The LOVELAND Next App is available for iOS and Android devices:    
* **[Download for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/loveland-next/id1338927298)**
* **[Download for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loveland.pr)**   
    
**Step 4:**   
When you're ready to start surveying property, open up the LOVELAND App on your smartphone and log in using your landgrid.com credentials.    

     
**Step 5:**   
Tap the person icon at the top left of your screen. You'll see text saying "Your Current Survey": tap this to look at surveys available to you and select the one you want.   
   
     
**Step 6:**    
To survey a property, tap the outline of the parcel you want to survey. The parcel you've selected will highlight in red, and its address and Google Street View image will appear at the bottom of the device's screen. Tap this bottom bar to display more info about the property, if needed. When you're ready to survey, tap the red circle with the "+" icon on the bottom bar to begin.

**Step 8:**    
      
When you've reached the end of your survey questions, you'll see two buttons: "Submit" or "Add Another Photo". If you'd like to add additional photos, tap "Add Another Photo" to keep taking pictures. When you're ready to send your survey and its data and photography to the Land Grid, tap "Submit".   
      
**Step 9:**    
Back in your landgrid.com account, you can navigate in the Project to the region you were surveying and click any highlighted parcel (denoting properties you've surveyed) to see the imagery and data. Or, you can clik the "Feed" icon on the sidebar to see a chronological stream of all the information you've collected in the project.    

**Note: if the survey project you're undertaking is large, you may want to enable "Quality Control" for the project where data will be accumulating. This gives you the option to approve or flag individual posts.**
