**The Project formerly known as Maps**

After you’ve made an account (congrats!), the next thing you’ll probably want to do is create a project. Projects are places where most of the Land Grid magic happens: it’s where you can import data, make surveys, style information, view the maps you’re making, and generally start to make sense of the information you’re gathering. 

**Note:** When using a free account, you only get one project. If you just can’t live with only one (and who can?), upgrade to a Pro account for only $10 a month and do all the projects your heart desires.
Creating a Project

While logged in to your Land Grid account, go to the top right of the page. Click on your username, and you’ll see a dropdown menu. Click “My Profile”, which will bring you to your home page. This is where you’ll be able to view all the projects associated with your account.

**To create a new project,** simply click the “New Project” button above the ‘Projects in this Account’ header.

To create a new map, simply click the “+ New Project” button just below your group name.

Then, give your Project a name and specify a location for the map. The location can be a city, neighborhood, or zip code. As you type your map’s location, options will appear in a drop-down below the text bar. Select one of those options to be sure your location is in the correct format. If no options appear under the text bar, check your spelling and make sure that the area you chose is part of Loveland’s national cadastre ([makeloveland.com/us](https://makeloveland.com/us)).

Once you specify a name and location for your map, you have several options:

* Click “Go to My Map” to view the map you just created and to experiment with features like drawing a focus area.
* Click “Create a Survey” to go directly to Site Control’s survey builder to create a custom survey.
* Click “Import Data” to import your own data or to connect data from an open data portal.
* Click “Browse Public Data” to explore Site Control datasets that have been made public by other users.
