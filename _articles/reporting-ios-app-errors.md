In order to track down the bug you experienced in our error logs, we need to know a few key bits of info:

1) The exact Date + Time the error last occurred.

_We use this to be able to inspect our logs and track down more info about your issue._

<small>Example: 7/22 4:52pm</small>

2) iPhone Version Number

<small>Example: 12.1</small>

3) Model Number 

<small>Example: A1901</small>

4) Landgrid App Version Number

<small>Example: 1.14</small>

5) The email you use to login to the Landgrid App

_We use this to be able to inspect our logs and track down more info about your issue._


**Note that:**

- The Model Number will never change, so you'll only need to get it once if you can associate it     with a single Surveyor or device.
- The iPhone Version will change occasionally.
- The Date+Time and Landgrid Version Number is needed for every bug.
- Below is the process for getting the iPhone Version Number, the Model Number, wnd the Landgrid App Version Number.
