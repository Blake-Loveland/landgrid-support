## A New Post

**For all Bulk data & API customers:**

**Data delivery & Initial set up:**

- 1-2 hours of initial set up support via email, phone or screen share.
- All bulk data is provided via SFTP as zip files of each county in the format of your choice (GeoPKG, CSV, GeoJSON, etc), using a pull model. We organize things on a county by county basis using the county’s FIPS code (geoid in our standard schema columns). We add or refresh 20-300 counties every month with data from the county source.
- Each month we replace the existing county zip file in a client’s download directory with the refreshed county files.


**Ongoing support:**

**Email support:**

- We are always available to answer any questions or concerns that you may have about our data.
- Depending on the issue, we are also available to provide helpful information & documentation to ingest & use the data.


**Data bugs:**

- Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us if you find something missing or not working with our data. 
- If it’s a bug, we work to fix them as quickly as possible. Even if some bugs take longer to fix, we will make sure to update you on our progress routinely.
- Since we work with hundreds of data customers, the criticality of the bug will define our priority but rest assured that we always find a way to address customer issues within 5-7 business days.

**Documentation & Help:**

-We provide all the necessary documentation and information at the data delivery time and many during the sales process as well.
- Parcel FAQ's - 
- Coverage Report - 
- Parcel Schema -  

-This apart we also offer & share code examples and implementation strategies. Especially with using our tileserver.  Because each application is different, we however can’t offer hands-on development or professional services support unless it was addressed in the agreement.
