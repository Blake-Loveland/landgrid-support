intro: Take a screenshot of your map in order to print it
---
At the moment, there is no direct way to print a map from your Site Control account. The best way to capture a static picture of your map is to take a screenshot on your computer.

We are working on a new feature that will make printing maps from Site Control a breeze. Stay tuned for updates!

If you are simply looking for a way to share your map with others, you can [check out this article](Share a Map) to learn how.
