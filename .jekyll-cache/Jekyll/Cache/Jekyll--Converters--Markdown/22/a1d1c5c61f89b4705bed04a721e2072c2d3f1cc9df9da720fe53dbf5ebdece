<p>You can change the name of your Project at any time.</p>

<p>While working in the Project whose name you’d like to change, click the gear icon on the left-hand sidebar, just under Overview.</p>

<p>A drawer will pop out, where you will see a selection of Project settings. Change the name to whatever you desire, then press “Save Project” to make changes permanent.</p>

<p>You can also write a description in the box below the title. Descriptions can be useful when you want to do something like embed your map in a web page – your description will be a part of the embed, giving people an introduction to your map.</p>
