<p><strong>Print PDF Map:</strong> clicking this will prompt a popup where you can generate a PDF image of your Project - not only the map, but the legend, and (if selected) summary details of the project.</p>

<p><strong>Save Image:</strong> a .PNG image will download of just the map extent as shown on your screen.</p>

<p><strong>Print a Specific Parcelâ€™s Info:</strong> You can print a specific propertiesâ€™ information by clicking the parcel, then â€˜Actionsâ€™ at the top right, then â€˜Print Parcelâ€™. The resulting PDF will look something like the following:
<img src="/img/Print_Parcel_Details.jpg" alt="Print_Parcel_Details.jpg" /></p>
