<p><strong>About Filter</strong>
Landgrid.com gives you powerful tools to explore and understand the data you bring to your account. One of these tools is Filter â€“ a search/query interface that allows you to select multiple criteria from data in LOVELANDâ€™s database as well as datasets and survey data you bring to your account.</p>

<p>In the Project where youâ€™d like to filter data, choose the â€œFilterâ€ tab on the left hand sidebar. Simply click in the blank text boxes next to a desired field and enter the values that you would like to select. For example, if you choose â€œVacantâ€ (assuming the dataset has occupancy data, of course), all parcels classified as â€œVacantâ€ will highlight on the map.</p>

<p>If you choose to filter by two options (say, â€œVacantâ€ and â€œPoor Conditionâ€), the results will show only parcels where BOTH criteria are true.</p>

<p>NOTE: Weâ€™re currently exploring an â€œExport Filter as Datasetâ€ option, so stay tuned! For now, users can export a filter by going to â€œListâ€, then exporting as a CSV, and reimporting.</p>
