I"<p>You can quickly and easily save properties with landgrid.com to look at later; we call them bookmarks. You have access to bookmarks with any paid landgrid.com account. Pro users are capped at 100 bookmarks; Team accounts and above get unlimited bookmarks.</p>

<p>To bookmark a property, first click on it in the map. The selected property will be highlighted in purple; a sidebar opens with any base data that we have on the property, including its address. At the top right corner of this sidebar is a purple button labeled â€˜Actionsâ€™; click this, then â€˜Add Bookmarkâ€™, and youâ€™ll have bookmarked your first property!</p>

<p>To view your bookmarks, first click â€œMy Profileâ€ in the dropdown menu found in the top right of the screen next to your name. Once here, click on the â€œBookmarksâ€ button toward the top of the page, and all of your bookmarked properties will be listed.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In order to <strong>delete</strong> a bookmark, you will need to navigate to the bookmarked property and click the bookmark tab icon next to the address a second time.</p>
