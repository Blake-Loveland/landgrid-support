<p>With landgrid.com, you can import data from CSVs and Excel spreadsheets to visualize, query, and work with the data on a parcel map.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Uploading data works best if source datasets contain a column with Parcel IDs so we can match precisely. It is possible to match with latitude/longitude or by address, but the margin of error may be higher.

<p>Below is a step-by-step guide to importing data from a CSV or Excel spreadsheet:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the <a href="https://support.landgrid.com/articles/new-project/">project</a> you’d like to upload data to. From the left sidebar, click the “Import Data” button.</li>
  <li>Click “Select a File” and navigate to the desired dataset’s location.</li>
  <li>Click “Import”.</li>
  <li>Once the data preview appears, select the column that contains the Parcel ID (we’ll try to guess, but make sure it’s correct)</li>
  <li>Based on the parcel IDs in your data, we’ll try to determine the city you’re importing data to – make sure this is correct and click the city that appears that matches the data you’re importing.</li>
  <li>Click “Finish”, and stand by for importing to complete. Progress bars on right side of screen will show the progress.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Larger datasets can take a while to upload, and there is a max of 200,000 rows of data that you can add to a Project. If you are working on a specific project that requires a huge dataset, let someone from the Loveland team know and we may be able to help you.</p>
